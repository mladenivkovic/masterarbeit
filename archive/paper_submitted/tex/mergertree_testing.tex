\section{Testing and Optimizing the Algorithm}\label{chap:tests}
%============================================================================

The current implementation of our merger tree algorithm needs several
free parameters to be chosen by the user. We present in this section
multiple tests that reveal the recommended values for these
parameters.  We use for this a single reference cosmological
simulation and analyze the merger trees we obtained for different set
of parameters.  A similar methodology was used in the Sussing Merger
Trees Comparison Project \citep{SUSSING_COMPARISON,
  SUSSING_CONVERGENCE, SUSSING_HALOFINDER,leeSussingMergerTrees2014a}.
This is why we adopt in this section several tests from this seminal
work, as they are quite efficient at testing the strengths and the
weaknesses of merger tree codes. They also allow for a direct
comparison of our new implementation with many other state-of-the-art
merger tree codes in the community.

%============================================================================
\subsection{Test Suite}\label{chap:testing_methods}
%============================================================================

We now list the different diagnostics we use to characterize the quality of
our merger tree algorithm.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setlength\itemsep{1em}
\item \emph{Length of the Main Branch of a Halo}
  
  The length of the main branch of a halo is simply defined as the
  number of snapshots in which a halo and all its progenitors are
  detected.  A halo at $z=0$ without any progenitors will be
  considered as newly formed and thus will have a main branch of
  length $1$.  If a halo appears to merge temporarily into another and
  re-emerges at a later snapshot, the missing snapshots will be
  counted towards the length of the main branch as if they weren't
  missing. Traditionally, finding long main branches is considered
  as a good thing for a merger tree code.
  
\item \emph{Number of Branches of a Halo}
  
  Another popular quantity is the number of branches of the tree
  leading to the formation of a halo at $z=0$.  The main branch is
  included in this count, thus the minimal number of branches is
  $1$. If a different choice of parameters leads to a reduction of the
  number of branches, it usually corresponds to an increase of the
  average length of the main branches and a smaller number of merger
  events.  In the hierarchical picture of structure formation, one
  would expect more massive clumps to have longer main branches and a
  higher number of branches.
  
\item \emph{Logarithmic Mass Growth of a Halo}
  
  The logarithmic mass growth rate of a halo is computed using the following
  finite difference approximation:
  %
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\de \log M}{\de \log t} \simeq
    \frac{(t_{k+1}+t_{k})(M_{k+1} -M_{k})}{(t_{k+1} - t_k)(M_{k+1} +
      M_{k})} \equiv \alpha_M(k, k+1)
  \end{equation}
  %
  where $k$ and $k+1$ are two consecutive snapshots, with the
  corresponding halo mass $M_k$ and $M_{k+1}$ and times $t_k$ and
  $t_{k+1}$. A convenient approach was proposed by \cite{SUSSING_CONVERGENCE}
  to reduce the range of values to the interval $(-1, 1)$ using the new variable
  %
  \begin{equation}
    \beta_M = \frac{2}{\pi}\arctan(\alpha_M) \label{eq:massgrowth}
  \end{equation}
  %
  Note that we expect the mass of dark matter haloes to increase
  systematically with time.  We also expect in some cases the mass to
  remain constant or even to decrease slightly.  We nevertheless
  expect the distribution of $\beta_M$ to be skewed towards $\beta_M >
  0$.  $\beta_M \rightarrow \pm 1$ imply $\alpha_M \rightarrow \pm
  \infty$, indicating suspiciously extreme cases of mass growth or
  mass loss.
  
\item \emph{Mass Growth Fluctuation of a Halo}
  
  Mass growth fluctuations are defined similarly as
  %
  \begin{equation}
    \xi_M = \frac{\beta_M(k, k+1) - \beta_M(k-1, k)}{2} \label{eq:massfluct}
  \end{equation}
  %
  where $k-1$, $k$, $k+1$ are three consecutive snapshots.  A smooth
  mass accretion history generally leads to $\xi_M \simeq 0$.  Strong
  deviations from zero could indicate an erratic behaviour, indicating
  extreme mass loss followed by extreme mass growth and vice versa.
  Within the standard model of structure formation, this behaviour is
  expected only during major merger events. Otherwise, it might
  indicate either a misidentification by the merger tree code or a
  misdetection by the halo finder.

%\item {\it Displacement statistics}
%  The Sussing Merger Trees Comparison Project also includes a
%  displacement statistic to quantify misidentifications,
%  \begin{equation}
%  \Delta_r = \frac { | \mathbf{r}_{k+1} - \mathbf{r}_k - 0.5
%    (\mathbf{v}_{k+1} + \mathbf{v}_k) (t_{k+1} - t_k) | } {
%    0.5(R_{200,k} + R_{200,{k+1}} + | \mathbf{v}_{k+1} + \mathbf{v}_k
%    | (t_{k+1} - t_k) }
%  \end{equation} 
%  where $\mathbf{r}_{k+1}$, $\mathbf{v}_{k+1}$ and $\mathbf{r}_k$,
%  $\mathbf{v}_k$ are the position and velocity of a clump at snapshot
%  $k+1$ and its progenitor at snapshot $k$, respectively; $t_{k+1}$
%  and $t_k$ are the cosmic times at which the two clumps were defined,
%  and $R_{200}$ is the radius that encloses an overdensity of 200
%  times the critical density $\rho_{c} = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G}$.
%  Values of $\Delta_r > 1$ would indicate a misidentification, so the
%  parameters minimising $\Delta_r$ should be preferred, provided the
%  acceleration is approximately uniform.  However, the obtained
%  $\Delta_r$ for all parameters showed almost no differences and no
%  indication of what parameters should be preferred, which is why the
%  results of the quantification of misidentifications were omitted
%  from this work.
 
\end{enumerate}

Ideally, we should have tested \texttt{ACACIA} on the dataset used in
\citet{SUSSING_COMPARISON} and \citet{SUSSING_HALOFINDER}.  This would
have enabled a direct comparison of the performance to other merger
tree codes.  However, \texttt{ACACIA} was designed to work on the fly
with the \ramses\ code.  Using it as a post-processing tool would
defeat its purpose and as a matter of fact handling foreign halo 
catalogues  has proven technically impossible.
Furthermore, we also want to demonstrate that the
\phew\ halo finder can be used within the \ramses\ code to produce
reliable merger trees.  For these various reasons, we have decided to
perform the same tests but using our own dataset generated on the fly by
\ramses.

Despite this limitation, we have performed a direct comparison to
other halo finders and merger tree codes using the exact same merger
tree parameters as in \citet{SUSSING_HALOFINDER}. The results are
given in Appendix~\ref{app:performance_comparison}.  Our results are
comparable to e.g. the \texttt{Sublink} and \texttt{VELOCIraptor} tree
builders with \texttt{AHF} or \texttt{Subfind} halo finders as
presented in \citet{SUSSING_HALOFINDER}, demonstrating that
\texttt{ACACIA} performs similarly than other state-of-the-art tools.

In this section, we would like to explore different parameters and see
how they affect the quality of the merger tree.  Our tests are
performed on a single DMO simulation with $256^3 \approx 1.7\times
10^7$ particles of identical mass $m_p = 1.55\times 10^9\msol$.  We
have adopted the following cosmological parameters: $H_0 =
70.4$~km~s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_m = 0.272$ and $\Omega_\Lambda =
0.728$.  For the clump finder, we have adopted a outer density
threshold of 80$\bar\rho$ and a saddle surface density threshold of
200$\bar\rho$, where $\bar\rho = \Omega_m \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G}$ is
the average density.  The minimal mass for clumps is set to 10
particles. Note that for the histogram of the logarithmic mass growth
and mass growth fluctuations, we adopt a threshold for the clump mass
of 200 particles for sake of visibility. Choosing a smaller mass
threshold would indeed give too much weight to small mass, poorly
resolved haloes in our statistical analysis.

The snapshot generation was set as follows: As virtually no haloes are
detected before $a\leq 0.1$, only a few snapshots are stored up to
$a=0.1$ in steps of $\Delta a \simeq 0.02$.  From this point on, more
frequent snapshots are created every $\Delta t \simeq 0.3$ Gyrs up
until $a = \tfrac{1}{3}$, after which an even smaller time interval of
$\Delta t \simeq 0.2$ Gyrs was chosen.  This choice resulted in 67
snapshots generated up to $z = 0$.  The simulation was then continued
for 3 further snapshots with $\Delta t \simeq 0.2$ Gyrs to ensure that
the merging events at $z = 0$ are actual mergers and not temporary
mergers that will re-emerge later.

%============================================================================
\subsection{Varying the Clump Mass Definition}
%============================================================================

In our current implementation, there are two important parameters that
can have a strong effect on the halo catalogue (beside the mass and
the density thresholds mentioned earlier) and the corresponding merger
tree.

The first one is the exact definition adopted for the mass of the
sub-haloes in the merit function.  For main haloes, there is no
ambiguity as the mass is defined as the sum of the masses of all
particles contained within the boundary of the halo (set by the outer
density isosurface). This is not the case for sub-haloes, because of the
unbinding process described in Section~\ref{chap:phew}. Indeed,
unbound particles are removed from their original sub-halo and passed
to the parent sub-halo in the hierarchy.  Clump masses are therefore
defined as the sum of the mass of all bound particles.  In the merit
function evaluation, we however consider two different cases to
compute the mass: 1- the mass is equal to the sum of the masses of
only the bound particles, like for sub-haloes or 2- the mass is equal
to the sum of the masses of all particles within their boundaries (set
by the saddle surface with neighbouring clumps), like for main haloes.
In the former case, the mass used in the merit function is identical
to the clump mass. It is referred to as the \exc\ case.  In the latter
case, the mass in the merit function is different that the sub-halo
mass definition but identical to the main halo mass definition.  We
refer to this case as \inc.

The second important definition is the exact boundedness criterion
adopted for the unbinding process.  As discussed in
Section~\ref{chap:phew}, we explored two different cases: When
particles are allowed to leave the outer boundary of their host clump
(and possibly come back later) or when particles are not allowed to
cross the saddle surface during their orbital evolution. In the first
case, we only require the binding energy to be negative, while in the
second case, the binding energy has to be smaller than the
gravitational potential of the nearest saddle point.  We call the
first case \nosad\ and the second case \sad.

    number of branches (right) for all clumps (halo and sub-halo)

    clump masses (expressed in particle numbers): less then 100 (top),
    100-500, 500-1000 and more than 1000 (bottom). We compare these
    histograms for four different cases: whether unbound particles are
    included (\inc) or excluded (\exc) in the evaluation of the merit
    function, and whether bound particles are \nosad\ or \sad.

    histograms for four different cases: whether unbound particles are

    function, and whether bound particles are \nosad\ or \sad.

  \label{fig:saddle_nosaddle_masses}
\end{figure}

\input{tables/saddle_nosaddle_global_stats}

We now test our algorithm with these four different options for the clump
masses, using the simulation presented in the previous section. Note
that we used here $n_{\rm mb}=200$ tracer particles to identify links
in the merger tree. We will study the impact of this other important
parameter in the next section.

We show in Figure~\ref{fig:saddle_nosaddle_mbl_nbranch} the histogram
of the length of the main branch and the histogram of the number of
branches for each clump (halo and sub-halo) at $z=0$ and for each of
our four different mass definitions. In all four cases, we see that more
massive clumps tend to have longer main branches and a higher number
of branches.  This is also visible from the average length of the main
branch and the average number of branches in different bins of halo
masses given in Table~\ref{tab:saddle_nosaddle}. This is a well-known
property of cosmological simulations in the hierarchical scenario of
structure formation.

Whether clump masses are defined in an \exc\ manner (like for
sub-haloes) or in an \inc\ manner (like for main haloes) in the merit
function has negligible effect on these two statistics. This means
that this a priori large difference in the mass definition of the
merit function has no effect on the linking process of the merger
tree.  The distinction between \sad\ and \nosad\ particles does not
change much for larger clumps but does change the length of the main
branch (and to a lesser extent the number of branches) for small mass
clumps (less than 100 particles). Our first idea was that
\sad\ particles might be better at identifying robust links between
snapshots. It turned out that the main effect of changing the mass
definition from \nosad\ to \sad\ is to reduce the mass of the clump and
to promote them systematically from a larger mass bin to a smaller
mass bin. We see indeed in
Figure~\ref{fig:saddle_nosaddle_mbl_nbranch} and
Table~\ref{tab:saddle_nosaddle} that the number of clumps is reduced
in the large mass bins and increased in the smallest mass bin,
explaining that this change in the mass definition merely transfers clumps
between different bins and affects the statistics accordingly.

We also note in Figure~\ref{fig:saddle_nosaddle_mbl_nbranch} that a few 
large clumps (with mass larger than 500 particles) at $z=0$ have a
main branch length of unity.  These large clumps don't have any
progenitor and thus essentially appeared out of nowhere. As explained
in \citet{SUSSING_COMPARISON}, this effect is present in many
state-of-the-art merger tree codes and is believed to be due to
fragmentation events at the periphery of large haloes leading to a
misidentification of a few rare progenitor-descendant links.

The histogram of the logarithmic mass growth shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:saddle_nosaddle_masses} is indeed skewed towards
$\beta_M > 0$, demonstrating that clump masses are on average growing.
Adopting a merit function based on the \inc\ or \exc\ mass definition
has here also no effect on the mass growth and mass growth fluctuation
statistics.  At first sight, using the \sad\ instead of the
\nosad\ definition would have led to more robust links and a smoother
mass growth. On Figure~\ref{fig:saddle_nosaddle_masses}, we do see in
the latter case more extreme mass growth around $\beta_M \rightarrow
\pm 1$ and mass growth fluctuations around $\xi_M \rightarrow \pm
1$. We verified that the increase in the number of these extreme
events for the \nosad\ case is in fact due to a larger number of small
sub-haloes that satisfy the adopted mass threshold of 200 particles.
This just means that mass growth statistics is more robust for large,
well resolved haloes, while smaller clumps, closer to the resolution
limit (between 10 and 100 particles; see discussion below) are less
reliable.

In conclusion, whether to use \inc\ or \exc\ mass definitions in the
merit function has no effect on the final merger trees, while using a
\sad\ definition for the clump mass is preferable, since it naturally
selects better resolved, higher mass clumps from the halo catalogue.

\end{figure}


In this section, we study the effect of varying the number of tracer
particles on our various diagnostics of tree quality. We show in
Table~\ref{tab:ntracers} the average number of branches and the
average length of the main branch for all our detected clumps at $z=0$
organised in different mass bins. We see that the effect of the number
of tracer particles used is quite mild. Even with as few as one tracer
particle do we manage to recover the correct average main branch
length. This is also true for small mass haloes, although with a
slightly reduced accuracy. This also validates our orphan particle
technique to track temporary merger events.

On a closer look, the average number of branch seems however more
affected by the number of tracer particles.  With only one tracer
particle we loose 30\% of the links associated to merger events.  This
can be easily explained by the fact that too few tracer particles
cannot be distributed across enough descendant candidates to identify
potential links. It appears that using 100 tracer particles seems to
be enough to recover most of the otherwise broken links. These
conclusions remain the same after looking at the histogram of the
number of branches and the histogram of the main branch length for the
same clumps in Figure~\ref{fig:ntracers_mbl_nbranch}. Here again, we
see the peak of the histogram of the number of branches being shifted
to the right when increasing the number of tracer particles. We also
see that using 100 tracer particles seems enough to almost recover the
correct distribution.

We now examine the effect of the number of tracers on the mass growth
(and on the mass growth fluctuations) of all our detected clumps
within the entire redshift range. We see in
Figure~\ref{fig:ntracers_masses} that the effect is very weak, except
for the extreme cases $\beta_M \simeq \pm 1$ and $\xi_M \simeq \pm 1$,
corresponding to spurious links in the merger tree. We believe that
these extreme mass growth cases correspond to broken links due to the
small number of tracer particles. Here again, using more than 100
tracer particles seem to get rid of most of these spurious cases.
Note that we include in these histograms only clumps with more than
200 particles.

We now study in details another spurious effect of our merger tree
algorithm, shared by many other merger tree code in the literature,
namely dead tree branches.  A dead branch arises when no descendant
could have been identified after a certain redshift, even after
looking for all subsequent snapshots using the corresponding orphan
particle. Such an event is called a ``Last Identifiable Descendant In
Tree'' or LIDIT.  When such a case occurs, it is customary to prune
the corresponding tree from the tree catalogue. When not enough tracer
particles are used, we expect such spurious dead links to
appear. Table~\ref{tab:ntracers-pruning} shows the statistics of these
LIDITs (or tree pruning events), which confirms that the number of
LIDITs decreases strongly when using more and more tracer
particles. We also show in the same table the typical and maximum mass
of the LIDITs. Interestingly, the maximum mass also strongly decreases
when using more tracer particles. When enough tracer particles are
used, we see that LIDITs are typically less massive than 200
particles. We believe they correspond to poorly resolved clumps that
are subject to all sorts of spurious numerical effects. Adopting a
conservative resolution limit of 200 particles per halo removes all the
LIDITs from our catalogue, as long as one uses more than 200 tracer
particles. 

We finally study a specific aspect of our merger tree algorithm,
namely the possibility to follow the temporary mergers of clumps that
travel through another clumps to emerges later as a distinct object.
We show in Table~\ref{tab:jumpers} the number of these temporary
mergers that we call ``jumpers'' as they represent links across
non-adjacent snapshots that we are able to ``repair'' using orphan
particles. When we increase the number of tracer particles, the total
number of jumpers decreases steadily, but on a closer look, this is
only true for poorly resolved clumps with less than 100 particles. For
larger clumps, the number of jumpers actually increases with the
number of tracer particles.  This is a similar behavior than for the
number of branches: More tracer particles allows more merger events to
be detected, but also allows more non-adjacent descendant candidates
to be found. We here also recommend to use 200 tracer particles as a
compromise between speed and proper detection of jumpers in the
simulation.

We show in Figure~\ref{fig:jumper-distances} the histogram of the
distance in time between the two non-adjacent snapshot of all jumpers
in our merger tree. We see that most jumpers have a distance of only 2
snapshots. They corresponds to clumps traversing another clump and
re-emerging a snapshot later as a distinct halo. We also see in
this histogram that the number of jumpers increases with the number of
tracer particles. But overall, the statistics of the distance between
jumpers is relatively robust, with only very rare cases with a
distance larger than 10 snapshots. Figure~\ref{fig:jumper-mass-ratio}
shows the histogram of the mass ratio between the jumper progenitor
and the jumper descendant.  As expected, it peaks at one, which means
that the mass of the clump that re-emerges in a later snapshot is
close to the mass of the clump that disappeared in an earlier
snapshot. Note that this is not due to the merit function, because for
jumpers we only use a single orphan particle to repair the link. This
is a clear sign that the same clump is identified before and after the
temporary merger.  We also see that the distribution is slightly
skewed toward mass ratio smaller than 1, with values always bounded
between 0.3 and 3. Only a few very rare cases show more extreme mass
ratios. This means that clumps hosting our orphan particles either
preserve their mass (over 2 snapshots) or loose mass (on average),
usually when the time between non-adjacent snapshots increases.

In conclusion, we found that $n_{\rm mb} \simeq 200$ is a safe choice
to obtain robust results for our merger tree algorithm, in light of
the diagnostics we have used in this section.  We also recommend
adopting a conservative mass threshold of 200 particles per clumps to
get rid of a few rare spurious dead branches that would need to be
pruned from the halo catalogue anyway.
