    The paper has undergone a major revision. Almost all sections were
    rephrased, we added and overall improved the analysis of the merger tree 
    algorithm, and added a new application of the trees to verify our results. 
    Our algorithm work on-the-fly, in parallel, and uses orphan galaxies to 
    establish links between progenitor and descendant haloes across non-adjacent 
    snapshots efficiently both speed-wise and memory-wise. Most other merger 
    tree codes can't offer all these features.
    As for its performance, the analysis we provided at the time of first
    submission was leaning heavily on the methods that the Merger Tree Comparison
    project employed, but it was not intended to reproduce their analysis
    exactly. Instead, the goal was to determine the quality of our trees
    depending on parameters which influence the merger trees. This intention
    still remains in the main body of our manuscript, however we have now added
    an appendix where we reproduce the conditions that were used in the Merger
    Tree Comparison Project as closely as possible. We compare our results 
    directly to other halo finders and merger tree algorithms, and find that our
    results are comparable with the results of multiple other codes, and are not
    at all worse.

    The merger tree algorithm is indeed the purpose of this paper. Nonetheless,
    both the abstract and the introduction have been re-written and state the
    purpose of the paper clearly now.

    We agree that the demonstration as it was at first submission, is indeed 
    indirect for the stellar mass functions.  As the referee noted, the 
    Behroozi method relies on applying fitting formulae to halos from a 
    different set of simulations and halo catalogues. For this reason, we 
    first showed that we obtain reasonable stellar mass functions with the 
    Behroozi method in our simulation set, which is obtained using different 
    methods, halo finders, cosmology, etc. However, the observed stellar mass 
    functions that we compared our results to are the same ones that have been 
    used to fit the parameters in the Behroozi et al. paper, hence the "ideal" 
    in some sense. By obtaining results close to the observed stellar mass 
    functions that have been used to calibrate the Behroozi et al. method we 
    wanted to show that we indeed can use the Behroozi method on our simulation
    set, and derive further observables from it.

    However, the stellar mass functions are indeed not a test of the merger 
    trees, as they only rely on the halo mass functions. For this reason, our 
    approach was to then compare other observable quantities derived from our 
    mock galaxy catalogues with observed data, in our case with the correlation 
    function. The mock galaxy catalogues rely heavily on the merger trees in two
    aspects:
    1)  The subhalo masses used to obtain the satellite galaxies are peak masses 
        during the subhalo's formation history
    2)  The merger trees allow us to introduce and track orphan galaxies and to 
        assign them a stellar mass.

    In the current version of the paper, we omitted the stellar mass functions, 
    but instead added radial number density and mass density profiles of galaxy 
    clusters. While we don't show what happens if we don't use the peak masses 
    of subhaloes, we do differentiate between results when orphan galaxies are 
    added to the mix, and when they are excluded. In both the correlation 
    function and the cluster profiles, we obtain much better results when 
    orphan galaxies are included. In our eyes, that is a success.

    For the purpose of directly comparing ACACIA to other merger tree codes, 
    ideally ACACIA should be tested on the same datasets and halo catalogues 
    that have been used in the Merger Tree Comparison Project papers, 
    Srisawat+13 and Avila+14. However, ACACIA was designed to work on the fly; 
    Using it as a post-processing utility would defeat its purpose. It is not,
    nor has it ever been, intended to be used as a standalone merger tree tool. 
    Furthermore, using foreign halo catalogues has proven to be technically 
    impossible.  It is not necessarily compatible with other halo finder's
    definitions and conventions of halos, subhalos, or their hierarchies.
    And lastly, we also want to demonstrate that the halo finder PHEW can be 
    used to produce reliable merger trees. 
    However, the results we show have not been intended for exact direct
    comparison with the results of the Comparison Project. The main purpose was
    to identify what parameters that ACACIA uses would yield the most reliable 
    merger trees. So instead, we perform the tests on our own datasets and halo 
    catalogues, described in Section 5.

    Nonetheless, to enable comparison to other halo finders and merger tree codes, 
    some of the tests have been performed using the exact same selection 
    criteria as they were in the Comparison Project, and the results are given 
    in appendix B. The results are comparable to e.g. the Sublink and VELOCIraptor 
    tree builders with AHF or Subfind halo finders in Avila et al. (2014), 
    demonstrating that ACACIA performs adequately well as its peers.

    With the exact same criteria applied, the results are much closer now. Also, 
    a more fair comparison would be to compare ACACIA to the properties in 
    Avila+14 instead of SMT13, since there the influence of the halo finders is 
    also taken into account. A detailed comparison is given in appendix B now.

    While it is true that PHEW has been described in detail in a previous paper,
    a rudimentary description of the way it works is necessary. The particle
    unbinding methods for PHEW are new and haven't been published, and the way
    that PHEW establishes hierarchies between substructure plays an important
    role for the particle unbinding methods: Unbound particles of substructure
    is being passed on to parent clumps for checking. Finally, we found that the
    definition of what particle is to be considered bound to a clump or not has
    an effect on the quality of merger trees, and we need to talk about the
    unbinding methods in order to discuss their influence on the merger trees.



> 6) How is it possible for the maximum number of particles in a clump to be 
> larger for the 'strictly bound' than for the 'loosely bound' version of the 
> model?

    The particle unbinding is performed following the structure hierarchy as 
    found by PHEW from the bottom up. Starting with the lowest level 
    substructure, i.e. the finest subhaloes present, unbound particles are 
    first assigned to the next higher level parent structure for checking, 
    and then passed on following the structure hierarchy. Once the main halo 
    level is reached, all present particles are assumed to be part of it, 
    regardless whether any of the previously mentioned conditions is satisfied.
    This way, when more particles are unbound from lower level structures, 
    the main halo clumps can have more particles. 

    (However, the maximal number of particles in a halo was part of an earlier 
    analysis that has been omitted from the paper, and as such is not necessary 
    to be mentioned as part of the analysis in the paper any more and has been 
    removed.)




> 7) Is having more progenitor clumps necessarily better?  Can this be 
> justified?

    I am not certain in which context this is meant.
    Using the strictly bound particle unbinding criterion leaves subhaloes with
    smaller masses, meaning that more progenitor clumps loose too much mass to
    satisfy the mass threshold to be considered "proper clumps" and are removed 
    from the catalogue. In this context, having more progenitor clumps because 
    the loosely bound unbinding criterion isn't used is not a good thing, since
    evidently using the stricly bound criterion gives much more robust results.
    It could also have been meant in the context of our findings that with
    increasing number of tracer particles $n_{mb}$, the number of 
    progenitor-descendant links across non-adjacent snapshots increases; But 
    since the halo catalogues are identical in those cases, it must mean that 
    we have found more progenitor candidates with increasing $n_{mb}$. 
    We consider the linking of progenitor-descendant pairs over non-adjacent 
    snapshots as the less preferrable method, because the links are established 
    using only one particle that is expected to be in a volatile environment. 
    (Indeed using $n_{mb}$=1 leads to quite bad results.) So within this 
    context, having more progenitor candidates is a preferrable predicament to 
    be in.

    This was indeed due to the discrete particle numbers and the application of 
    the arctan() to reduce the values within a finite range. The spikes are also
    present in the reference papers Srisawat+13 and Avila+14, albeit not this
    pronounced.

    Jumpers, or links between progenitors and descendants across non-adjacent
    snapshots using one tracer "orphan" particle, in general are a less 
    reliable way of linking progenitors to descendants than using a multitude 
    of particles between two snapshots.
    Using jumpers corresponds to tracing a clump using only one particle, 
    but over larger time intervals than between two adjacent snapshots.
    It's reasonable to expect that a lot can happen to a single particle 
    over large times, particularly so within host clumps. Since orphan tracer 
    particles are only introduced once a clump has been merged into another, 
    the orphan tracer particles will most likely start their life out in 
    volatile environments. Hence not using jumpers should be preferred way of 
    linking progenitors and descendants.

    The issue is more related to how many particles are needed for a clump to be
    well resolved. We indeed found that going below 100-200 particles doesn't
    give good results, but that is not directly related to the merger tree 
    algorithm.

    In the current version of the paper, in almost all analyses we either separate 
    the clumps in groups by particle number, or exclude low particle clumps.

    This Section has been removed.

    We agree that it is not a particularly rigorous test, we see it more as a
    proof of concept. The tests of the merger trees were performed in section 4
    of the current verion of the paper (previously Section 3).



> Here are some more specific comments.  Section 4.1 -- I don't see the need 
> for a basic primer on correlation functions; this is well known.  
    
    Some introductory text has been removed. However, I think keeping the 
    remaining equations is important, as they describe the method used to 
    compute the correlation function. I.e. we do it via Fourier transform, 
    as opposed to counting pairs, which is another popular way of computing 
    correlation functions.

    The effect of the merger tree is not visible at this point. The stellar 
    mass functions are computed using central galaxies only, and those depend 
    on the current main halo masses only. As explained above, the stellar mass
    functions were not intended to be a measure of quality of the merger trees,
    but to demonstrate that the halos that we find can indeed be used to apply
    the SMHM relation to obtain reasonable SMFs.
    In any case, the SMFs have now been removed from the paper in favour of
    radial profiles of galaxy clusters.

    This point has been clarified better in the text. The effect of the merger 
    trees is both to use the peak mass of subhaloes to find the satellite galaxy 
    mass, as well as to introduce, track, and assign a mass to orphan galaxies.
    We highlight the contributions of the merger trees by differentiating
    between the cases where orphan galaxies are included and where they are
    excluded.
