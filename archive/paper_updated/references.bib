	abstract = {A halo merger tree forms the essential backbone of a semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution. Recent studies have pointed out that extracting merger trees from numerical simulations of structure formation is non-trivial; different tree building algorithms can give differing merger histories. These differences should be carefully understood before merger trees are used as input for models of galaxy formation. We investigate the impact of different halo merger trees on a semi-analytic model. We find that the z = 0 galaxy properties in our model show differences between trees when using a common parameter set. The star formation history of the Universe and the properties of satellite galaxies can show marked differences between trees with different construction methods. Independently calibrating the semi-analytic model for each tree can reduce the discrepancies between the z = 0 global galaxy properties, at the cost of increasing the differences in the evolutionary histories of galaxies. Furthermore, the underlying physics implied can vary, resulting in key quantities such as the supernova feedback efficiency differing by factors of 2. Such a change alters the regimes where star formation is primarily suppressed by supernovae. Therefore, halo merger trees extracted from a common halo catalogue using different, but reliable, algorithms can result in a difference in the semi-analytic model. Given the uncertainties in galaxy formation physics, however, these differences may not necessarily be viewed as significant.},

	abstract = {We propose a heuristic model that displays the main features of realistic theories for galaxy bias. We first show that the low-order clustering statistics of the dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and density profiles of dark-matter haloes. The quasi-linear mass correlations are in fact reproduced well by a model of independent randomly-placed haloes. The distribution of galaxies within the halo density field depends on: (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation number - the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo. The first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups. For the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. This second assumption is essential if small-scale galaxy correlations are to remain close to a single power law, rather than flattening in the same way as the correlations of the overall density field. These simple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass density. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current interest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy correlations for a flat $\Omega$=0.3 model
	($\Lambda$CDM), but not for an $\Omega$=1 model with the same power
	spectrum ($\tau$CDM). This is an inevitable consequence of cluster
	normalization for the power spectra: cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high $\Omega$, and hence display enhanced
	small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the $\Lambda$CDM model is lower than that of the mass,
	allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of galaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.},

	abstract = {We investigate an analytic model to compute the non-linear power spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. The model is based on Press-Schechter haloes, which cluster and have realistic dark matter profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two
	contributions, one from correlations between the haloes and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the results of N-body simulations, provided that the concentration parameter decreases with the halo mass. The galaxy power spectrum differs from the dark matter power spectrum because the pair-weighted number of galaxies does not scale with the halo mass and because most haloes harbour a central galaxy. If the pair-weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters, then the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with a slope close to the observed over several orders of magnitude in scale. Such a model also predicts a later onset of non-linear clustering in comparison with dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the cold dark matter (CDM) models with the data. A generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale-dependent and non-monotonic. This is particularly important for red or elliptical galaxies, which are preferentially found in larger mass haloes and for which the bias in the power spectrum may be scale-dependent even on large scales. Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed through galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo masses dominate at different scales and because larger haloes host more than one galaxy. We compute predictions for the cross-correlation coefficient as a function of scale and discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum.},

	abstract = {We have used a combination of high resolution cosmological N-body simulations and semi-analytic modelling of galaxy formation to
	investigate the processes that determine the spatial distribution of galaxies in cold dark matter (CDM) models and its relation to the spatial distribution of dark matter. The galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency with which galaxies form in haloes of different mass. In small mass haloes, galaxy formation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes, whereas in large mass haloes, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of the gas. As a result, the mass-to-light ratio of haloes has a deep minimum at the halo mass, \textasciitilde{}1012Msolar, associated with L* galaxies, where galaxy formation is most efficient. This dependence of galaxy formation efficiency on halo mass leads to a scale-dependent bias in the distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. On large scales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to the bias in the distribution of massive haloes. On small scales, the correlation function is determined by the interplay between various effects including the spatial exclusion of dark matter haloes, the distribution function of the number of galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent, dynamical friction. Remarkably, these processes conspire to produce a correlation function in a flat, $\Omega$0=0.3, CDM model that is close to a power law over

Several scenarios for the nature of LBGs are explored, which may be broadly categorized into models in which high-redshift star formation is driven by collisional starbursts and those in which quiescent star formation dominates. For each model, we make predictions for the LBG overdensity distribution, the variance of counts in cells, the correlation length, and close pair statistics. Models that assume a one-to-one relationship between massive dark matter halos and galaxies are disfavored by close pair statistics, as are models in which colliding halos are associated with galaxies in a simplified way. However, when modeling of gas consumption and star formation is included using a semianalytic treatment, the quiescent and collisional starburst models predict similar clustering properties and none of these models can be ruled out based on the available clustering data. None of the ‘‘realistic'' models predict a strong dependence of clustering amplitude on the luminosity threshold of the sample, in apparent conflict with some observational results.},

	version of this model. This is based on a more accurate, self-consistent
	treatment of subhalo mass loss and revised results for the subhalo mass
	function (SHMF) to address this question anew. We find that the
	mass-luminosity relation, at high mass, particularly for first brightest
	galaxies and less so for group total, is almost independent of the
	actual luminosity function considered, when luminosity is scaled by the
	characteristic luminosity L*. Additionally, the shape of the

	brightest galaxy has a much weaker dependence on halo mass,
	L1 \textasciitilde{} M0.28, in good agreement with observations

	two additional possible sources for remaining discrepancies: problems
	with the underlying cosmology and with the observational mass
	determination. We find that, when comparing with observations and for a

	morphological diversity shows that the spin of low-mass blue galaxies is preferentially aligned with their neighbouring filaments, while

	simulations are used to track the formation and merging of dark matter
	haloes as a function of redshift. Simple prescriptions, taken directly
	from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, are adopted for gas
	cooling, star formation, supernova feedback and the merging of galaxies
	within the haloes. This scheme enables us to explore the clustering
	properties of galaxies, and to investigate how selection by luminosity,
	colour or type influences the results. In this paper we study the
	properties of the galaxy distribution at z=0. These include B- and
	K-band luminosity functions, two-point correlation functions, pairwise
	peculiar velocities, cluster mass-to-light ratios, B-V colours, and star
	formation rates. We focus on two variants of a cold dark matter (CDM)
	cosmology: a high-density (Omega =1) model with shape-parameter Gamma
	=0.21 (tau CDM), and a low-density model with Omega =0.3 and Lambda =0.7
	(Lambda CDM). Both models are normalized to reproduce the I-band
	Tully-Fisher relation of Giovanelli et al. near a circular velocity of
	220 km s\^-1. Our results depend strongly both on this normalization and
	on the adopted prescriptions for star formation and feedback. Very
	different assumptions are required to obtain an acceptable model in the
	two cases. For tau CDM, efficient feedback is required to suppress the
	growth of galaxies, particularly in low-mass field haloes. Without it,
	there are too many galaxies and the correlation function exhibits a
	strong turnover on scales below 1 Mpc. For Lambda CDM, feedback must be
	weaker, otherwise too few L\_* galaxies are produced and the correlation
	function is too steep. Although neither model is perfect, both come
	close to reproducing most of the data. Given the uncertainties in
	modelling some of the critical physical processes, we conclude that it
	is not yet possible to draw firm conclusions about the values of
	cosmological parameters from studies of this kind. Further observational

Mergers of galaxies based on subhalos also result in many more bright red galaxies at high \$z\$. The semi-analytical model we adopt is similar to those used in earlier semi-analytical studies, except that we consider the effect of a prolonged cooling in small halos and that we explicitly follow the chemical enrichment in the interstellar medium. We use our model to make predictions for the properties of the galaxy population at low redshift and compare them with various current observations. We find that our model predictions can match the luminosity functions of galaxies in various wavebands redder than the u-band. The shape of the luminosity function at bright end is well reproduced if galaxy mergers are modeled with the merger trees of subhalos and the steep faint-end slope can be moderated if the gas cooling time in low-mass halos is comparable to the age of the universe. The model with subhalos resolved can reproduce the main features in the observed color bimodal distribution, though it still predicts too many bright blue galaxies. The same model can also match the color-magnitude relation for elliptical galaxies in clusters, the metallicity-luminosity relation.},

	abstract = {We study the behaviour of multiple radiative-cooling algorithms implemented in seven semianalytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation, including a new model we propose in this paper. We use versions of the models without feedback and apply them to dark matter haloes growing in a cosmological context, which have final virial masses that range from 1011 to 1014 M . First, using simplified smoothly growing halo models, we demonstrate that the different algorithms predict cooling rates and final cold gas masses that differ by a factor of $\sim$5 for massive haloes ($\geq$1012 M ). The algorithms are in better agreement for less massive haloes because they cool efficiently and, therefore, their cooling rates are largely limited by the halo accretion rate. However, for less massive haloes, all the SAMs predict less cooling than corresponding 1D hydrodynamic models. Secondly, we study the gas-accretion history of the central galaxies of dark matter haloes using merger trees. The inclusion of mergers alters the cooling history of haloes by locking up gas in galaxies within small haloes at early times. For realistic halo models, the dispersion in the cold gas mass predicted by the algorithms is 0.5 dex for high-mass haloes and 0.1 dex for low-mass haloes, while the dispersion in the accretion rate is about two times larger. Comparing to cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations, we find that most SAMs systematically underpredict the gas-accretion rates for low-mass haloes but overpredict the gas-accretion rates for massive haloes. Although the models all include both `rapid'- and `slow'-mode accretion, the transition between the two accretion modes varies between models and also differs from the simulations. Finally, we construct a new phenomenological model that explicitly incorporates cold halo gas and a gradual transition between the cold and hot modes of gas accretion to illustrate that such a class of models can better match the results from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The large dispersion in cooling rates between different SAMs influences parameter choices for other galaxy physics, including star formation and feedback. Therefore, careful parametrizations of the multimode gas cooling and accretion mechanisms in simulations are necessary to ensure that the predictions from SAMs are reliable.},

	technique is self-consistent in that it takes account of the facts that
	(1) subhalos are accreted at different times and (2) the properties of
	satellite galaxies may evolve after accretion. Using observations of
	galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) out to z \textasciitilde{} 4, the conditional SMF
	at z \textasciitilde{} 0.1 obtained from Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy group catalogs,
	and the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of galaxies at z \textasciitilde{} 0.1 as
	a function of stellar mass, we constrain the relation between galaxies
	and dark matter halos over the entire cosmic history from z \textasciitilde{} 4 to the
	present. This relation is then used to predict the median assembly
	histories of different stellar mass components within dark matter halos
	(central galaxies, satellite galaxies, and halo stars). We also make
	predictions for the 2PCFs of high-z galaxies as function of stellar
	mass. Our main findings are the following: (1) Our model reasonably fits
	all data within the observational uncertainties, indicating that the
	$\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology is consistent with a wide variety of
	data regarding the galaxy population across cosmic time. (2) At low-z,
	the stellar mass of central galaxies increases with halo mass as M
	0.3 and M gsim 4.0 at the massive and low-mass
	ends, respectively. The ratio M *, c /M reveals a maximum of
	\textasciitilde{}0.03 at a halo mass M \textasciitilde{} 1011.8 h -1 M
	$\odot$, much lower than the universal baryon fraction (\textasciitilde{}0.17).
	At higher redshifts the maximum in M *, c /M remains close to
	\textasciitilde{}0.03, but shifts to higher halo mass. (3) The inferred timescale for
	the disruption of satellite galaxies is about the same as the dynamical
	friction timescale of their subhalos. (4) The stellar mass assembly
	history of central galaxies is completely decoupled from the assembly
	history of its host halo; the ratio M *, c /M initially
	increases rapidly with time until the halo mass reaches \textasciitilde{}1012
	h -1 M $\odot$, at which point M *, c /M
	\textasciitilde{} 0.03. Once M $>$\textasciitilde{} 1012 h -1 M $\odot$,
	there is little growth in M *, c , causing the ratio M
	*, c /M to decline. In Milky Way (MW)-sized halos more than
	half of the central stellar mass is assembled at z $<$\textasciitilde{} 0.5. (5) In
	low-mass halos, the accretion of satellite galaxies contributes little
	to the formation of their central galaxies, indicating that most of
	their stars must have formed in situ. In massive halos more than half of
	the stellar mass of the central galaxy has to be formed in situ, and the
	accretion of satellites can only become significant at z $<$\textasciitilde{} 2. (6)
	The total mass in halo stars is more than twice that of the central
	galaxy in massive halos, but less than 10\% of M *, c in
	MW-sized halos. (7) The 2PCFs of galaxies on small scales hold important
	information regarding the evolution of satellite galaxies, which at
	high-z is predicted to be much steeper than at low-z, especially for
	more massive galaxies. We discuss various implications of our findings
	regarding the formation and evolution of galaxies in a $\Lambda$CDM

	abstract = {In this paper we present a new, essentially empirical, model for the relation between the mass of a dark matter halo/subhalo and the
	luminosity of a galaxy hosted in it. To estimate this, we replace the assumption of linearity between light and mass fluctuations with the assumption of monotonicity between galaxy light and halo or subhalo mass. We are enabled to proceed with this less restrictive ansatz by the availability of new, very high-resolution dark matter simulations and more detailed and comprehensive global galactic luminosity functions.
	
	We find that the relation between halo/subhalo mass and hosted galaxy luminosity is fairly well fitted by a double power law. The relation between halo mass and group luminosity has a shallower slope for an intermediate-mass region and is fairly well fitted by a two-branch function, with both branches double power laws. Both relations asymptote to L\textasciitilde{}M4 at low M, while at high mass the former follows L\textasciitilde{}M0.28 and the latter L\textasciitilde{}M0.9.
	
	In addition to the mass-luminosity relation, we also derive results for the occupation number, luminosity function of cluster galaxies, group luminosity function and multiplicity function. Then, using a
	prescription for the mass function of haloes in under/overdense regions and some further assumptions on the form of the mass density
	distribution function, we further derive results for biasing between mass and light and mass and galaxy number, the light distribution function and the void probability distribution.
	
	Our results for the most part seem to match well with observations and previous expectations. We feel this is a potentially powerful way of modelling the relation between halo mass and galaxy luminosity, because the main inputs are readily testable against dark matter simulation results and galaxy surveys, and the outputs are free from the
	uncertainties of physically modelling galaxy formation.},

	high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The halo samples include both the host halos and the ‘‘subhalos,'' distinct gravitationally bound halos within the virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the HOD, the probability distribution for a halo of mass M to host a number of subhalos N, is similar to that found in semianalytic and N-body+gasdynamics studies. Its first moment, M, has a complicated shape
	consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a power-law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by Poisson statistics at high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for M$<$\textasciitilde{}4. We show that the
	HOD can be understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a central galaxy and the probability to host a given number Ns of satellite galaxies. The former can be
	approximated by a steplike function, while the latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by its first moment. The first moment of the satellite HOD can be well described by a simple power law s$>$\textasciitilde{}M$\beta$ with $\beta$\textasciitilde{}1
	for a wide range of number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation distribution found in simulations. At z=0, the two-point correlation function (CF) of galactic halos can be well fitted by a power law down to \textasciitilde{}100 h-1 kpc with an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. The dependence of correlation amplitude on the number density of objects is in general agreement with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. At redshifts z$>$\textasciitilde{}1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at small scales, where the CF steepens because of a more pronounced one-halo component. The departures from the power law may thus be easier to detect in high-redshift galaxy surveys than at the present-day epoch. They can be used to put useful constraints on the environments and formation of galaxies. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of high-redshift clustering is dangerous and is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation length and slope of the correlation function.},

The novel feature of the model is the use of the maximum circular velocity at the time of accretion, Vaccmax, for subhalos, the halos located within virial regions of larger halos. We argue that for subhalos in

	Vnowmax. The simulations and our model

	post-processing tools with which one transforms particles into
	``invisible'' dark matter haloes and from thereon into
	luminous galaxies. Aims: Although a fair amount of work has been
	devoted to growing Monte-Carlo merger trees that resemble those built
	from an N-body simulation, comparatively little effort has been invested
	in quantifying the caveats one necessarily encounters when one extracts
	trees directly from such a simulation. To somewhat revert the tide, this
	paper seeks to provide its reader with a comprehensive study of the
	problems one faces when following this route. Methods: The first
	step in building merger histories of dark matter haloes and their
	subhaloes is to identify these structures in each of the time outputs
	(snapshots) produced by the simulation. Even though we discuss a
	particular implementation of such an algorithm (called AdaptaHOP) in
	this paper, we believe that our results do not depend on the exact
	details of the implementation but instead extend to most if not all
	(sub)structure finders. To illustrate this point in the appendix we
	compare AdaptaHOP's results to the standard friend-of-friend (FOF)
	algorithm, widely utilised in the astrophysical community. We then
	highlight different ways of building merger histories from AdaptaHOP
	haloes and subhaloes, contrasting their various advantages and
	drawbacks. Results: We find that the best approach to (sub)halo
	merging histories is through an analysis that goes back and forth
	between identification and tree building rather than one that conducts a
	straightforward sequential treatment of these two steps. This is rooted
	in the complexity of the merging trees that have to depict an inherently
	dynamical process from the partial temporal information contained in the
	collection of instantaneous snapshots available from the N-body
	simulation. However, we also propose a simpler sequential ``Most
	massive Substructure Method'' (MSM) whose trees approximate those
	obtained via the more complicated non sequential method.

	abstract = {We describe a new algorithm for finding substructures within dark matter haloes from Nbody simulations. The algorithm relies upon the fact that dynamically distinct substructures in a halo will have a local velocity distribution that differs significantly from the mean, i.e. smooth background halo. We characterize the large-scale mean field using a coarsely grained cell-based approach, while a kernel-smoothing process is used to determined the local velocity distribution. Comparing the ratio of these two estimates allows us to identify particles that are strongly clustered in velocity space relative to the background and thus resident in a substructure. From this population of outliers, groups are identified using a Friends-of-Friendslike approach. False positives are rejected using Poisson noise arguments. This approach does not require a search of the full phase-space structure of a halo, a non-trivial task, and is thus computationally advantageous. We apply our algorithm to several test cases and show that it identifies not only subhaloes, bound overdensities in phase space, but can recover tidal streams with a high purity. Our method can even find streams which do not appear significantly overdense either physically or in phase space.},

We confirm earlier results that smaller halos show a notable difference in formation time with a mild dependence on large-scale environment. However, using a semi-analytic model, we found that on average the growth rate of the stellar mass of central galaxies is largely insensitive to large-scale environment. Although our results show that the star formation rate (SFR) and the stellar mass of central galaxies in smaller halos are slightly affected by the assembly bias of halos, those galaxies are faint and the difference in the SFR is minute, therefore it is challenging to detect it in real galaxies given the current observational accuracy. Future galaxy surveys, such as the BigBOSS experiment and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which are expected to provide observational data for fainter objects, will provide a chance to test our model predictions.},

These merger trees are used to calculate the galaxy-galaxy merger rate as a function of descendant stellar mass, progenitor stellar mass ratio, and redshift. We demonstrate that the most appropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy-galaxy merger consists in taking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reaches its maximum stellar mass. Additionally, we avoid effects from `orphaned' galaxies by allowing some objects to `skip' a snapshot when finding a descendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined `infall' moment. Adopting these definitions, we obtain well-converged predictions for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which are qualitatively similar to the halo-halo merger rate except for the last one: a strong correlation with redshift that evolves as $\sim$ (1 + z)2.4-2.8, a power law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence on descendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellar masses greater than $\sim$ 2 \texttimes{} 1011 M . These trends are consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies (M${_\ast}$ 1010 M ), but in tension with some recent observations of the close pair fraction for massive galaxies (M${_\ast}$ 1011 M ), which report a nearly constant or decreasing evolution with redshift. Finally, we provide a fitting function for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate which is accurate over a wide range of stellar masses, progenitor mass ratios, and redshifts.},

We explore a three-parameter model in which the number of LBGs per dark halo scales like a power law in the halo mass: N(M)=(M/M1)S for
	M$>$Mmin. Here, Mmin is the minimum mass halo that can host an LBG, M1 is a normalization parameter, associated with the mass above which haloes host more than one observed LBG, and S determines the strength of the mass-dependence. We show how these three parameters are constrained by three observable properties of LBGs: the number density, the large-scale bias and the fraction of objects in close pairs. Given these three quantities, the three unknown model parameters may be estimated analytically, allowing a full
	exploration of parameter space. As an example, we assume a $\Lambda$CDM

We find that the standard SHAM connecting the luminosity of galaxies to the maximum circular velocity of subhalos well reproduces the luminosity dependence of redshift-space clustering of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in a wide range of scales from 0.3 to 40 Mpc/h. The result indicates that the SHAM approach is very promising for establishing a theoretical model of redshift-space galaxy clustering without additional parameters. We also test color abundance matching using two different proxies for colors: subhalo age and local dark matter density following the method by Masaki et al. (2013b). Observed clustering of red galaxies exhibits much stronger Fingers-of-God effect than blue galaxies. We find that the subhalo age model describes the observed color-dependent redshift-space clustering much better than the local dark matter density model. The result infers that the age of subhalos is a key ingredient to determine the color of galaxies.},

Predictions for the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the relationship between dark matter hosts and substructures, are based on a high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation. We associate galaxies with halos and subhalos using subhalo abundance matching, performing a comprehensive analysis which investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (a) which halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar masses and luminosities, (b) how much scatter is in this relationship, and (c) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies are destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed conditional stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. The data put tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass, on the scatter between halo and galaxy properties, and on the underlying conditional stellar mass function. These data rule out several halo properties commonly used in abundance matching, largely because the satellite fractions in the models disagree with those data. We show that an abundance matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity of their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of \$0.20 $\backslash$pm 0.03\$ dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included. This will yield important constraints for galaxy formation models, and also provides encouraging indications that the galaxy--halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity for future precision studies of the dark Universe.},

Our method is massively parallel (up to 10\^5 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations ($>$10\^10 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper (Knebe et al 2011) has shown Rockstar to have class-leading recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery as compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results which demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or satellite average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km/s at z=0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar .},

Combined with an adaptive smoothing kernel for finding the densities, this method is spatially adaptive, coordinate-free, and numerically straightforward. One can proceed to process the output by truncating groups at a particular density contour and combining groups that share a (possibly different) density contour.

  abstract = {We measure the anisotropy of dark matter flows on small scales (\textasciitilde{}500 
kpc) in the near environment of haloes using a large set of simulations.
We rely on two different approaches to quantify the anisotropy of the
cosmic infall: we measure the flows at the virial radius of the haloes
while describing the infalling matter via fluxes through a spherical
shell; and we measure the spatial and kinematical distributions of
satellites and substructures around haloes detected by the subclump
finder ADAPTAHOP described for the first time in the appendix. The two
methods are found to be in agreement both qualitatively and
quantitatively via one- and two-point statistics.

The peripheral and advected momenta are correlated with the spin of the
embedded halo at levels of 30 and 50 per cent. The infall takes place
preferentially in the plane perpendicular to the direction defined by
the spin of the halo. We computed the excess of equatorial accretion
both through rings and via a harmonic expansion of the infall.

The level of anisotropy of infalling matter is found to be \textasciitilde{}15 per cent.
The substructures have their spin orthogonal to their velocity vector in
the rest frame of the halo at a level of about 5 per cent, suggestive of
an image of a flow along filamentary structures, which provides an
explanation for the measured anisotropy. Using a ‘synthetic' stacked
halo, it is shown that the positions and orientations of satellites
relative to the direction of spin of the halo are not random even in
projection. The average ellipticity of stacked haloes is 10 per cent,
while the alignment excess in projection reaches 2 per cent. All
measured correlations are fitted by a simple three-parameter model.

We conclude that a halo does not see its environment as an isotropic
perturbation, we investigate how the anisotropy is propagated inwards
using perturbation theory, and we discuss briefly the implications for
weak lensing, warps and the thickness of galactic discs.},

	abstract = {In hierarchical cosmologies the evolution of galaxy clustering depends 
	both on cosmological quantities such as Omega, Lambda and P(k), which
	determine how collapsed structures - dark matter haloes - form and
	evolve, and on the physical processes - cooling, star formation,
	radiative and hydrodynamic feedback - which drive the formation of
	galaxies within these merging haloes. In this paper we combine
	dissipationless cosmological N-body simulations and semi-analytic models
	of galaxy formation in order to study how these two aspects interact. We
	focus on the differences in clustering predicted for galaxies of
	differing luminosity, colour, morphology and star formation rate, and on
	what these differences can teach us about the galaxy formation process.
	We show that a ‘dip' in the amplitude of galaxy correlations between z=0
	and z=1 can be an important diagnostic. Such a dip occurs in low-density
	CDM models, because structure forms early, and dark matter haloes of
	mass \textasciitilde{}10\^12M\_solar, containing galaxies with luminosities \textasciitilde{}L\_*, are
	unbiased tracers of the dark matter over this redshift range; their
	clustering amplitude then evolves similarly to that of the dark matter.
	At higher redshifts, bright galaxies become strongly biased and the
	clustering amplitude increases again. In high density models, structure
	forms late, and bias evolves much more rapidly. As a result, the
	clustering amplitude of L\_* galaxies remains constant from z=0 to z=1.
	The strength of these effects is sensitive to sample selection. The dip
	becomes weaker for galaxies with lower star formation rates, redder
	colours, higher luminosities and earlier morphological types. We explain
	why this is the case, and how it is related to the variation with
	redshift of the abundance and environment of the observed galaxies. We
	also show that the relative peculiar velocities of galaxies are biased
	low in our models, but that this effect is never very strong. Studies of
	clustering evolution as a function of galaxy properties should place
	strong constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution.},

	generate ensembles of merging histories for present-day dark matter haloes with a wide range of circular velocities. A galaxy is assumed to form from gas which cools and turns into stars at the centre of a halo until that halo merges with a more massive object. At this time the galaxy loses its source of new gas and becomes a non-dominant object within a larger group or cluster. Our methods thus enable us to ‘look inside' present dark matter haloes and investigate the formation, evolution and merging of the galaxies that they contain. We begin by investigating the properties of haloes with V\_c\_ = 220 km s\^-1\^, and use the observed properties of our Milky Way system to tune the free parameters that regulate star formation, hydrodynamic feedback from supernovae and the transformation of discs into spheroids by mergers. We then show that the same parameters lead to good agreement between the properties of galaxies in a V\_c\_ = 1000 km s\^-1\^ halo and observational data on the Virgo cluster of galaxies. This model correctly reproduces the observed trends in the luminosity, colour, gas content and
	morphology of galaxies. Turning to an investigation of the properties of the galaxy population as a whole, we highlight a problem that arises when applying this model to a ‘standard' cold dark matter universe. If the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation is set by the properties of our Milky Way system, we find that standard CDM predicts too many haloes and results in a B-band luminosity density of the Universe that is a factor of 2 too high. The only apparent solution to this problem is to assume that many haloes remain observationally undetectable. We also compute the gas mass-luminosity relation for galaxies, the variation in galaxy morphology as a function of luminosity, star formation histories according to environment, the field galaxy luminosity function, and predictions for faint galaxy counts in the B and K bands. We conclude that, although it would be premature to attempt a detailed quantitative fit to specific cosmological models, the qualitative agreement between the data and the general picture that we present is already very encouraging.},

During the past decade, the art of object finding in these simulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself. A multitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques have been spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will provide the same (physical) information about the structures of interest. Here we summarize and extent previous work of the "halo finder comparison project": we investigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders. To this extent we decipher and discuss differences in halo finding methods, clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties. We observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objects leading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and Vmax function, but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by all finders differ. The strength of the variation, however, depends on the property studied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass, and the peak value of the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derived quantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. Our study indicates that the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codes stems from the distinct particle collection methods and -- to a minor extent -- the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles is implemented. We close with a discussion of the relevance and implications of the scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analytical galaxy formation models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general.},

These finders span a wide range of techniques and methodologies to extract and quantify substructures within a larger non-homogeneous background density (e.g. a host halo). This includes real-space-, phase-space-, velocity-space- and time-space-based finders, as well as finders employing a Voronoi tessellation, Friends-of-Friends techniques or refined meshes as the starting point for locating substructure. A common post-processing pipeline was used to uniformly analyse the particle lists provided by each finder. We extract quantitative and comparable measures for the subhaloes, primarily focusing on mass and the peak of the rotation curve for this particular study. We find that all of the finders agree extremely well in the presence and location of
substructure and even for properties relating to the inner part of the subhalo (e.g. the maximum value of the rotation curve). For properties that rely on particles near the outer edge of the subhalo the agreement is at around the 20 per cent level. We find that the basic properties (mass and maximum circular velocity) of a subhalo can be reliably recovered if the subhalo contains more than 100 particles although its presence can be reliably inferred for a lower particle number limit of 20.

We finally note that the logarithmic slope of the subhalo cumulative number count is remarkably consistent and {$<$}1 for all the finders that reached high resolution. If correct, this would indicate that the larger and more massive, respectively, substructures are the most dynamically interesting and that higher levels of the (sub)subhalo hierarchy become progressively less important.},

  abstract = {Numerical methods have become a powerful tool for research in astrophysics, but their utility depends critically on the availability of suitable simulation codes. This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's computing hardware. Here we discuss recent methodological progress in the GADGET code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in timescales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle number density in the simulated volume. The GADGET-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial conditions generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {Navarro, Frenk, \& White have recently found numerically that the density profile of dark-matter halos can be described by a universal two-parameter function over a broad range of halo masses. The profile is singular, approaching the halo center with {$\rho$} {$\propto$} r-1. It had been argued previously that radially distorted, gravitationally lensed images of background sources in galaxy clusters, so-called radial arcs, required a flat core in the cluster density profile. Such radial arcs have so far been detected in two galaxy clusters, in apparent contradiction with a singular density profile. I show here that the profile suggested by Navarro et al. can produce radial arcs despite its central singularity, and describe how the two parameters of the profile can be determined in clusters where radial and tangential arcs are observed. I then apply this analysis to the two clusters where radial arcs were detected. In both cases, the redshifts of the radial arcs are yet unknown, hence definitive conclusions on the profile parameters cannot yet be drawn. Numerically determined values for the parameters of cluster-sized halos can, however, be used to predict the range of the unknown arc redshifts, thus providing a direct observational test for the proposed density profile. A potential difficulty with the profile is that the radial magnification of tangential arcs is large, hence tangential arcs should be thick or their sources should be very thin in the radial direction.},

We provide halo mass (M500) estimates for each of these groups derived from a calibration between the optical richness of bright galaxies (Mr -20.5) within 1 Mpc, and X-ray-derived mass for a small subset of 129 groups and clusters with X-ray measurements. For 20 157 high-mass groups and clusters with M500 {$>$} 1013.7 M{$\odot$}, we find that the catalogue has a purity of {$>$} 97 per cent and a completeness of {$\sim$} 90 per cent. We derive the mean (stacked) surface number density profiles of galaxies as a function of total halo mass in different mass bins. We find that derived profiles can be well-described by a projected NFW profile with a concentration parameter ( c {$\equiv$} r200/rs {$\approx$} 2.6) that is approximately a factor of two lower than that of the dark matter (as predicted by Nbody cosmological simulations) and nearly independent of halo mass. Interestingly, in spite of the difference in shape between the galaxy and dark matter radial distributions, both exhibit a high degree of self-similarity. We also stack the satellite profiles based on other observables, namely redshift, BCG luminosity, and satellite luminosity and colour. We see no evidence for strong variation in profile shape with redshift over the range we probe or with BCG luminosity (or BCG luminosity fraction), but we do find a strong dependence on satellite luminosity and colours, in agreement with previous studies. A self-consistent comparison to several recent semi-analytic models of galaxy formation indicates that: (1) beyond {$\approx$} 0.3r500 current models are able to reproduce both the shape and normalisation of the satellite profiles; and (2) within {$\approx$} 0.3r500 the predicted profiles are sensitive to the details of the satellite-BCG merger timescale calculation. The former is a direct result of the models being tuned to match the global galaxy luminosity function combined with the assumption that the satellite galaxies do not suffer significant tidal stripping, even though their surrounding dark matter haloes can be removed through this process. Combining our results with measurements of the intracluster light should provide a way to inform theoretical models on the efficacy of the tidal stripping and merging processes.},

  abstract = {We explore the near-infrared (NIR) K-band properties of galaxies within 93 galaxy clusters and groups using data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey. We use X-ray properties of these clusters to pinpoint cluster centers and estimate cluster masses. By stacking all these systems, we study the shape of the cluster luminosity function and the galaxy distribution within the clusters. We find that the galaxy profile is well described by the Navarro, Frenk, \& White (NFW) profile with a concentration parameter c \$ 3, with no evidence for cluster mass dependence of the concentration. Using this sample, whose masses span the range from 3 ; 1013 to 2 ; 1015 M , we confirm the existence of a tight correlation between total galaxy NIR luminosity and cluster binding mass, which indicates that NIR light can serve as a cluster mass indicator. From the observed galaxy profile, together with cluster mass profile measurements from the literature, we find that the mass-to-light ratio is a weakly decreasing function of cluster radius and that it increases with cluster mass. We also derive the mean number of galaxies within halos of a given mass, the halo occupation number. We find that the mean number scales as N / M 0:84\AE 0:04 for galaxies brighter than MK {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A21, indicating that high-mass clusters have fewer galaxies per unit mass than low-mass clusters. Using published observations at high redshift, we show that higher redshift clusters have higher mean occupation numbers than nearby systems of the same mass. By comparing the luminosity function and radial distribution of galaxies in low-mass and high-mass clusters, we show that there is a marked decrease in the number density of galaxies fainter than M\~A as one moves to higher mass clusters; in addition, extremely luminous galaxies are more probable in high-mass clusters. We explore several processes, including tidal interactions and merging, as a way of explaining the variation in galaxy population with cluster mass.},

In addition to {$\sim$} 10, 000 spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies, we use deep ugri-band imaging to estimate photometric redshifts and stellar masses, and then statistically subtract fore- and background sources using data from the COSMOS survey. We measure the galaxy number density and stellar mass density distributions in logarithmically spaced bins over 2 orders of magnitude in radial distance from the BCGs. For projected distances in the range 0.1 {$<$} R/R200 {$<$} 2.0, we find that the stellar mass distribution is well-described by an NFW profile with a concentration of c = 2.03 {$\pm$} 0.20. However, at smaller radii we measure a significant excess in the stellar mass in satellite galaxies of about 1011 M per cluster, compared to these NFW profiles. We do obtain good fits to generalised NFW profiles with free inner slopes and to Einasto profiles. To examine how clusters assemble their stellar mass component over cosmic time, we compare this local sample to the GCLASS cluster sample at z {$\sim$} 1, which represents the approximate progenitor sample of the low-z clusters. This allows for a direct comparison, which suggests that the central parts (R{$<$}0.4 Mpc) of the stellar mass distributions of satellites in local galaxy clusters are already in place at z {$\sim$} 1, and contain sufficient excess material for further BCG growth. Evolving towards z = 0, clusters appear to assemble their stellar mass primarily onto the outskirts, making them grow in an inside-out fashion.},

  abstract = {Subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) is a widely used method to connect galaxies with dark matter structures in numerical simulations. SHAM predictions agree remarkably well with observations, yet they still lack strong theoretical support. We examine the performance, implementation, and assumptions of SHAM using the `Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environment' (EAGLE) project simulations. We find that Vrelax, the highest value of the circular velocity attained by a subhalo while it satisfies a relaxation criterion, is the subhalo property that correlates most strongly with galaxy stellar mass (Mstar). Using this parameter in SHAM, we retrieve the real-space clustering of EAGLE to within our statistical uncertainties on scales greater than 2 Mpc for galaxies with 8.77 {$<$} log 10(Mstar[M{$\odot$}]) {$<$} 10.77. Conversely, clustering is overestimated by 30 per cent on scales below 2 Mpc for galaxies with 8.77 {$<$} log 10(Mstar[M{$\odot$}]) {$<$} 9.77 because SHAM slightly overpredicts the fraction of satellites in massive haloes compared to EAGLE. The agreement is even better in redshift space, where the clustering is recovered to within our statistical uncertainties for all masses and separations. Additionally, we analyse the dependence of galaxy clustering on properties other than halo mass, I.e. the assembly bias. We demonstrate assembly bias alters the clustering in EAGLE by 20 per cent and Vrelax captures its effect to within 15 per cent. We trace small differences in the clustering to the failure of SHAM as typically implemented, I.e. the Mstar assigned to a subhalo does not depend on (I) its host halo mass, (II) whether it is a central or a satellite. In EAGLE, we find that these assumptions are not completely satisfied.},

Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than \$r\^\{-2\}\$ near the center and steeper than \$r\^\{-2\}\$ near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

In the galaxy halo mass range 3 \texttimes{} 1010 M{$\odot$} {$\leq$} Mh {$\leq$} 3 \texttimes{} 1013 M{$\odot$} the Mh\textendash Lr, Mstar\textendash Mh, and MBH\textendash Mh are well represented by a double power law, with a break at Mh,break {$\approx$} 3 \texttimes{} 1011 M{$\odot$}, corresponding to a mass in stars Mstar {$\sim$} 1.2 \texttimes{} 1010 M{$\odot$}, to a r{${_\ast}$}-band luminosity Lr {$\sim$} 5 \texttimes{} 109 L{$\odot$}, to a stellar velocity dispersion {$\sigma$} {$\simeq$} 88 km s-1, and to a black hole mass MBH {$\sim$} 9 \texttimes{} 106 M{$\odot$}. The {$\sigma$}\textendash Mh relation can be approximated by a single power law, though a double power law is a better representation. Although there are significant systematic errors associated to our method, the derived relationships are in good agreement with the available observational data and have comparable uncertainties. We interpret these relations in terms of the effect of feedback from supernovae and from the active nucleus on the interstellar medium. We argue that the break of the power laws occurs at a mass which marks the transition between the dominance of the stellar and the AGN feedback.},

  abstract = {It has long been regarded as difficult if not impossible for a cosmological model to account simultaneously for the galaxy luminosity, mass, and velocity distributions. We revisit this issue using a modern compilation of observational data along with the best available large-scale cosmological simulation of dark matter (DM). We find that the standard cosmological model, used in conjunction with halo abundance matching (HAM) and simple dynamical corrections, fits\textemdash at least on average\textemdash all basic statistics of galaxies with circular velocities V circ {$>$} 80 km s-1 calculated at a radius of \textasciitilde 10 kpc. Our primary observational constraint is the luminosity-velocity (LV) relation\textemdash which generalizes the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations in allowing all types of galaxies to be included, and provides a fundamental benchmark to be reproduced by any theory of galaxy formation. We have compiled data for a variety of galaxies ranging from dwarf irregulars to giant ellipticals. The data present a clear monotonic LV relation from \textasciitilde 50 km s-1 to \textasciitilde 500 km s-1, with a bend below \textasciitilde 80 km s-1 and a systematic offset between late- and early-type galaxies. For comparison to theory, we employ our new {$\Lambda$}CDM "Bolshoi" simulation of DM, which has unprecedented mass and force resolution over a large cosmological volume, while using an up-to-date set of cosmological parameters. We use HAM to assign rank-ordered galaxy luminosities to the DM halos, a procedure that automatically fits the empirical luminosity function and provides a predicted LV relation that can be checked against observations. The adiabatic contraction of DM halos in response to the infall of the baryons is included as an optional model ingredient. The resulting predictions for the LV relation are in excellent agreement with the available data on both early-type and late-type galaxies for the luminosity range from Mr = -14 to Mr = -22. We also compare our predictions for the "cold" baryon mass (i.e., stars and cold gas) of galaxies as a function of circular velocity with the available observations, again finding a very good agreement. The predicted circular velocity function (VF) is also in agreement with the galaxy VF from 80 to 400 km s-1, using the HIPASS survey for late-type galaxies and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) for early-type galaxies. However, in accord with other recent results, we find that the DM halos with V circ {$<$} 80 km s-1 are much more abundant than observed galaxies with the same V circ. Finally, we find that the two-point correlation function of bright galaxies in our model matches very well the results from the final data release of the SDSS, especially when a small amount of scatter is included in the HAM prescription.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting the demographics of dark matter (DM) substructure is of paramount importance for many fields of astrophysics, including gravitational lensing, galaxy evolution, halo occupation modelling, and constraining the nature of DM. Because of its strongly non-linear nature, DM substructure is typically modelled using N-body simulations, which reveal that large fractions of DM subhaloes undergo complete disruption. In this paper, we use both analytical estimates and idealized numerical simulations to investigate whether this disruption is mainly physical, due to tidal heating and stripping, or numerical (i.e. artificial). We show that, contrary to naive expectation, subhaloes that experience a tidal shock {$\Delta$}E that exceeds the subhalo's binding energy, |Eb|, do not undergo disruption, even when {$\Delta$}E/|Eb| is as large as 100. Along the same line, and contrary to existing claims in the literature, instantaneously stripping matter from the outskirts of a DM subhalo also does not result in its complete disruption, even when the instantaneous remnant has positive binding energy. In addition, we show that tidal heating due to high-speed (impulsive) encounters with other subhaloes (`harassment') is negligible compared to the tidal effects due to the host halo. Hence, we conclude that, in the absence of baryonic processes, the complete physical disruption of CDM substructure is extremely rare and that most disruption in numerical simulations therefore must be artificial. We discuss various processes that have been associated with numerical overmerging and conclude that inadequate force softening is the most likely culprit.},

While the dense halo environment rapidly strips subhalos of their dark mass, the compact luminous material can remain intact for some time, making the correspondence of galaxies with severely stripped subhalos unclear. Many galaxy evolution models assume that satellite galaxies eventually merge with their central galaxy, but this ignores the possibility of satellite tidal disruption. We use a high-resolution N -body simulation of cosmological volume to explore satellite galaxy merging/disruption criteria based on dark matter subhalo dynamics. We explore the impact that satellite merging/disruption has on the Halo Occupation Distribution and radial profile of the remnants. Using abundance matching to assign stellar mass/luminosity to subhalos, we compare with observed galaxy clustering, satellite fractions, cluster satellite luminosity functions, finding that subhalos reproduce well these observables. Our results imply that satellite subhalos corresponding to {$>$} 0.2 L{${_\ast}$} galaxies must be well-resolved down to 1 - 3\% of their mass at infall to robustly trace the galaxy population. We also explore a simple analytic model based on dynamical friction for satellite galaxy infall, finding good agreement with our subhalo catalog and observations.},

Yet, halo clustering strength depends upon properties other than mass, such as formation time, an effect known as assembly bias. If galaxy characteristics are correlated with these auxiliary halo properties, the basic assumption of standard HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for assembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation statistics. We construct realistic mock galaxy catalogues that exhibit assembly bias as well as companion mock catalogues with identical HODs, but with assembly bias removed. We fit HODs to the galaxy clustering in each catalogue. In the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs describe the true HODs well, validating the methodology. However, in all cases with assembly bias, the inferred HODs exhibit significant systematic errors. We conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxy clustering is subject to significant systematic errors induced by assembly bias. Efforts to model and/or constrain assembly bias should be priorities as assembly bias is a threatening source of systematic error in galaxy evolution and precision cosmology studies.},

We carefully tally all apsis points and use them to distinguish haloes that are infalling for the first time from those that occupy more evolved orbits. We find that roughly 21 per cent of resolved subhaloes within a host's virial radius are currently on first infall, and have not yet reached their first orbital pericentre; roughly 44 per cent are still approaching their first apocentre after infall. For the range of host masses studied, roughly half of all accreted systems were pre-processed prior to infall, and about 20 per cent were accreted in groups. We confirm that the entire population of accreted subhaloes \textendash{} often referred to as ``associated'' subhaloes \textendash{} extends far beyond the virial radii of their hosts, with roughly half currently residing at distances that exceed {$\approx$} 1.2 \texttimes{} r200. Many of these backsplash haloes have gained orbital energy since infall, and occupy extreme orbits that carry them well past their initial turnaround radii. Such extreme orbits are created during the initial accretion and dissolution of loosely bound groups, but also through penetrating encounters between subhaloes on subsequent orbits. The same processes may also give rise to unexpectedly abrupt losses of orbital energy. These effects combine, giving rise to a large variation in the ratio of sequent apocentres for accreted systems. We find that, within 2 virial radii from host centres, the concentrations of first-infall haloes are remarkably similar those of isolated field haloes, whereas backsplash haloes, as well as systems that were pre-processed, are considerably more concentrated.},

  abstract = {We present VELOCIraptor, a massively parallel galaxy/(sub)halo finder that is also capable of robustly identifying tidally disrupted objects and separate stellar halos from galaxies. The code is written in C++11, use the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and OpenMP Application Programming Interface (API) for parallelisation, and includes python tools to read/manipulate the data products produced. We demonstrate the power of the VELOCIraptor (sub)halo finder, showing how it can identify subhalos deep within the host that have negligible density contrasts to their parent halo. We find a subhalo mass-radial distance dependence: large subhalos with mass ratios of {$\greaterequivlnt$}10-2 are more common in the central regions than smaller subhalos, a result of dynamical friction and low tidal mass loss rates. This dependence is completely absent in (sub)halo finders in common use, which generally search for substructure in configuration space, yet is present in codes that track particles belonging to halos as they fall into other halos, such as hbt+. VELOCIraptor largely reproduces the dependence seen without tracking, finding a similar radial dependence to hbt+ in well-resolved halos from our limited resolution fiducial simulation.},

  abstract = {(Abridged) The 7-year WMAP data and improved astrophysical data rigorously test the standard cosmological model and its extensions. By combining WMAP with the latest distance measurements from BAO and H0 measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest LCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is n\_s=0.968+-0.012, a measurement that excludes the scale-invariant spectrum by 99.5\%CL. The other parameters are also improved from the 5-year results. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, sum(m\_nu){$<$}0.58eV, and the effective number of neutrino species, N\_eff=4.34+0.86-0.88. We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis. We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z=1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. With the 7-year TB power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved to Delta(alpha)=-1.1+-1.4(stat)+-1.5(syst) degrees. We report significant detections of the SZ effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data. However, it is a factor of 0.5 to 0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically-expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope collaboration.},

  abstract = {Merger trees harvested from cosmological N-body simulations encode the assembly histories of dark matter halos over cosmic time and are a fundamental component of semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. The ability to compare the tools used to construct merger trees, namely halo finders and tree building algorithms, in an unbiased and systematic manner is critical to assess the quality of merger trees. In this paper, we present the dendrogram, a novel method to visualise merger trees, which provides a comprehensive characterisation of a halo's assembly history\textemdash tracking subhalo orbits, halo merger events, and the general evolution of halo properties. We show the usefulness of the DENDROGRAM as a diagnostic tool of merger trees by comparing halo assembly simulation analysed with three different halo finders\textemdash VELOCIRAPTOR, AHF, and ROCKSTAR\textemdash and their associated tree builders. Based on our analysis of the resulting dendrograms, we highlight how they have been used to motivate improvements to VELOCIRAPTOR. The DENDROGRAM software is publicly available online, at: https://github.com/rhyspoulton/MergerTree-Dendrograms.},

  abstract = {Numerical methods have become a powerful tool for research in astrophysics, but their utility depends critically on the availability of suitable simulation codes. This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's computing hardware. Here we discuss recent methodological progress in the GADGET code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in timescales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle number density in the simulated volume. The GADGET-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial conditions generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},
