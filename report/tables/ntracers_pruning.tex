	\caption{
		Trees pruned from the merger tree catalogue for varying numbers of clump tracer particles $n_{mb}$ throughout all snapshots. 
		``LIDIT'' is an abbreviation of ``last identifiable descendant in tree''. 
		For LIDITs no further descendants could be identified throughout the simulation and consequently their tree was pruned from the merger tree catalogue.
        A ``jumper'' refers to a clump that has been merged into another clump at some snapshot, but re-emerged at a later snapshot, like shown in figure \ref{fig:jumper-demo}.
